# Excel-Bike-Sharing-Project
## Project Overview
This Excel project focuses on creating a dynamic dashboard for analyzing a bike-sharing dataset. The primary objective is to identify the various factors affecting bike-sharing services, such as monthly trends, seasonality, and weather patterns. The project involves multiple steps, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization through dynamic elements like pivot tables and charts.

## Key Components:
### Data Cleaning:

- Addressed missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant data to ensure a clean and reliable dataset.
- Standardized formats for dates, and categorized fields such as seasons and working days (weekdays vs. weekends).

### Data Analysis:

- Explored the dataset to analyze bike-sharing trends over months, across different seasons, and during specific weather conditions.
- Generated insights on how various factors like weather patterns and weekdays versus weekends impact the total number of bike rides.

### Data Visualization:

- Developed a dynamic dashboard that includes interactive elements such as filters for seasons and working days.
- Created pivot tables to aggregate and summarize the data, making it easier to generate insights.
- Built various charts to visualize data, including:
     1. A bar chart displaying monthly bike rides for 2011 and 201
     2. A comparison of bike rides versus weather patterns (Rainy, Cloudy, Sunny).

## Dashboard Details:
### Bike Rides Per Month:
- The first visualization is a bar chart showcasing the total number of bike rides each month over the two-year period (2011 and 2012).
- This visualization helps in identifying the peak months and any seasonal variations affecting the number of bike rides.

### Bike Rides vs Weather in 2011/2012:
This section focuses on how different weather conditions—Rainy, Cloudy, and Sunny—impacted the total bike rides. It provides insights into user behavior during various weather patterns.
The bar chart shows a clear relationship between weather conditions and the number of bike rides, with sunny days having the highest number of rides.
### Slicers:
- Seasons Slicer: Users can toggle between different seasons (Spring, Summer) to see how seasonal changes affect bike-sharing trends.
- Working Day Slicer: This Slicer allows the comparison between weekdays and weekends/holidays to analyze how the day type impacts bike usage.

## Tools and Features:
- **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize bike-sharing data and generate aggregate metrics such as total rides per month, per season, and by weather conditions.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Interactive Slicers for seasonality and working days to update the charts and tables on the dashboard.
-**Charts:** Bar charts to visualize trends in bike-sharing across different time frames and weather conditions.

## Key Insights:
- **Seasonal Trends:** The number of bike rides typically peaks during summer months, indicating that warm weather encourages more bike usage.
- **Weather Impact:** Sunny weather sees significantly higher bike rides compared to rainy or cloudy conditions.
- **Working Days vs. Weekends:** There may be variations in bike usage between weekdays and weekends, with different patterns based on work schedules and leisure time.

  ## How to Use This Dashboard:
- **Slicers:** Use the filters on the right to select specific seasons or day types.
- **Charts:** The bar charts automatically update based on your filter selections.
- **Pivot Tables:** Pivot tables summarize the underlying data and can be expanded for more granular insights.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pivot Tables and Charts:** For aggregating and displaying data trends.
- **Slicers:** To enable dynamic filtering of data.
